## 🧠 Curriculum & Key Learnings

### Day 1: Agentic Reasoning Patterns
Moved beyond "Prompt-Response" architecture to build agents capable of iterative reasoning and self-correction. Focused on the core "Loop" where the agent perceives, thinks, and acts.

### Day 2: The Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Explored how agents interact with the physical world. Implemented function calling to allow the model to execute Python code and interface with secure external APIs.

### Day 3: Advanced Context Engineering
Developed sophisticated memory systems. This included implementing session services to maintain state and context compaction techniques to ensure efficient token usage in long-term interactions.

### Day 4: Reliability & LLM-as-a-Judge
Focused on the "Production Gap." Built evaluation frameworks to measure agent performance objectively, using one model to evaluate the accuracy and safety of another.

### Day 5: Multi-Agent Systems & Production
Studied the future of specialized AI. Explored the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol where specialized agents collaborate to solve complex, multi-layered problems at scale.
